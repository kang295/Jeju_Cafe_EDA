# 🏝️ Cafe in Jeju Island (EDA) 🏖️

**Background and Objective**:

Jeju Island is the most popular destination for tourists visiting South Korea. It boasts exotic scenery, atmosphere, delicious cuisine, and a concentration of cafes and other attractions. In particular, in 2022, with 13.8 million visitors and a consumer expenditure of 3.278 trillion won, it's evident that consumer spending is substantial. I aspire to open a café on Jeju Island in the future. Before that, I intend to analyze Jeju Island consumers, their spending patterns, and related factors to determine where to open a café for optimal business impact.
